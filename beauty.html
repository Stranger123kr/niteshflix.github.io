<h2><font color="white" text size="5px">Facial massages are a common practice that a lot of women follow as a part of their beauty routine, and rightly so,
 because of there too many benefits of a face massage. It is a natural way to relieve stress and is to enhance your mood. 
 This is an amazing beauty tip for the face as it helps stimulate the production of collagen and blood in the skin. Regularly massaging your face tightens skin and lifts your facial muscles. 
 This is an amazing anti-ageing treatment and works well to give you a youthful glow. Additionally, face massages also benefit inflamed skin conditions such as acne and rosacea. 
 Light manipulation on the skin increases blood flow and oxygen which is needed for healing, plus it helps to expel toxins that are often responsible for breakouts.</h2></font>
