		<p><font color="white" text size="5px">There’s a special kind of power in having healthy, strong nails, whether you work the nail colors, go polish-free, 
		or love nude nail colors. Healthy nails (and even the results of good nail cuticle care) are one of those less-visible confidence boosters, 
		like wearing a fancy pair of underwear just because or splurging on amazing socks to wear under your boots.
Whether your nail care is a form of self-care, an indulgence, or just routine maintenance, keeping your nails in tip-top shape is a worthwhile investment.
 And here’s the good news: Healthy nails require an investment of time, not money.
The best route to stronger, longer nails is mostly through simple lifestyle habits, not pricy nail tools. 
But getting healthy nails also means kicking some bad habits, such as using your nails as a built-in pocket knife.
 For doable, helpful nail tips, we talked to the experts for the everyday dos and don’ts of nail care. Follow these steps, and you’ll have stronger, 
 longer nails before you know it.</p></font>
