	<h1><font color="black" text size="6px"><u>five Reasons Your Spa Needs Disposables & Single Use Supplies</u></font></h1>
	<img src="disposible.jpg"></img>
<p><font color="blue" text size="5px">Whether you’re a spa owner, esthetician, nail tech, massage therapist, or salon stylist, 
providing an exceptional client experience is essential to your business.</p></font>
 

<h1><b><u><font color="black">1. Clients Expect Single Use Supplies</font></b></u></h1>
<center><img src="download.jpg"></img></center>
<p><font color="white" text size="5px">Satisfying client expectations is one of the most important things a spa can do to build a solid book of clients. Even in our eco-conscious world, clients expect disposable items in spas and salons.

As the spa industry has grown, spa clients have become savvier consumers. One thing they have learned is the value of spa disposables and supplies.
 Consumer education materials provided by everyone from beauty bloggers to state boards of health or cosmetology stress the importance of proper sanitation 
 in spas.
Consumers quickly learn which spa supplies should be disposable and how everything else must be sanitized and disinfected.</p></font><br>
<h1><b><u><font color="black">2. Disposable Supplies Keep Spas Sanitary</font></b></u></h1>
<center><img src="download (1).jpg"></img></center>
<font color="white" text size="5px"><p>All states regulate the cleanliness of spas and salons. States require spas to clean, sanitize, disinfect, and sterilize workstations, equipment, supplies, and facilities. Spas must document compliance with proper hygiene protocols.

While spa directors and salon managers appreciate the importance of cleanliness, compliance with the increasing requirements is usually not their favorite part of the job. Significant time is spent training staff on the protocols, ensuring time is available between clients to comply with the protocols and implementing quality assurance measures to verify that employees follow the protocols every time.

This time investment is reduced when spa disposables can be used. For example, in states that allow salons to use approved disposable pedicure liners,
 the time savings add up. Instead of disinfecting the bowls with a 10-minute soak after every client, the liner can simply be switched out. 
 That’s one less process nail technicians need to remember, allowing them to focus on their clients.
When spas properly store and use disposable supplies, they comply with safety and sanitation requirements. No extra steps are needed to disinfect anything, and documentation is minimal. 
Little time is required to train staff on using disposables, and the QA process is simple. Many spa directors appreciate the way that spa disposables streamline their work and reduce their compliance burdens.</p><br></font>
<h1><b><u><font color="black">3. For Efficiency, Spa Disposables Can’t Be Beat</font></b></u></h1>
<center><img src="images.jpg"></img></center>
<p><font color="white" text size="5px">From an efficiency perspective, disposables can help you streamline spa operations by saving you or your staff from washing towels all day and disinfecting pedicure bowls between each client. Disposable cleansing towels and pedicure liners could help your spa and salon tasks run smoother.

Reusable table sheets and washcloths are excellent choices, but sometimes spa treatments can be messy. Oils, tints, and tanning lotions will stain sheets and washcloths. 
To save your linens from these types of products, you may want to rely on disposables at times. Additionally, 
if the inventory of spa disposables and supplies is properly managed, you won’t run out of linens because the laundry wasn’t done or too many sheets got stained.</p><br></font>

<h1><b><u><font color="black">4. Spa Disposables Offer a Quicker Turnaround Between Services</font></b></u></h1>
<font color="white" text size="5px"><p>One of the benefits of disposable salon and spa supplies is saving time, which can translate into cost savings.
 The time spent on sanitizing and disinfecting supplies or washing, folding, and storing linens can be spent serving clients.
 No prep or cleanup required. A quicker turnaround time between treatments offers an advantage for busy spas and salons with a high volume of client</p><br></font>
<h1><b><u><font color="black">5. Disposable Supplies Provide Flexibility</font></b></u></h1>
<font color="white" text size="5px"><p>Many disposable spa supplies are multitaskers. For example, cleansing wipes can be used to remove makeup before a facial, prepare skin for waxing, or to wipe up spills during services. Keeping one product on hand for many purposes streamlines ordering and managing the supply cabinet.

Instead of ordering specific supplies for every service, choose a few high-quality, versatile products and buy in bulk. The savings will add up because larger quantities usually cost less, and ordering and tracking one or two products take less time than managing a complicated order or placing frequent orders.

While regulations mandate that certain spa supplies be single use, spa managers have flexibility with other items. The decision to use spa disposables must consider the spa’s brand and promise to clients, what clients expect and want, costs in terms of dollars and staff time, and other factors particular to each spa or salon.
 Many spa directors and salon managers have found that using spa disposables can streamline their services and assist in compliance with sanitation regulations.</p><br></font>
